Price appreciation in GTBank, International Breweries, Mobil and 18 other stocks was what the Nigerian needed to sustain rally on Thursday.

The Oil & Gas sector led gainers, up 2.8% due to bargain hunting in MOBIL and OANDO, the Insurance and Consumer Goods indices rose 1.0% and 0.6% respectively owing to buying interest in WAPIC, AIICO, International Breweries and GUINNESS. The 2.6% gain by GTBank marginally drove the Banking index higher by 0.02%, but the Industrial Goods and AFR-ICT indices closed flat. UPDCREIT (+10.0%), NCR (+10.0%) and MOBIL (+9.9%) led the top gainers while ROYALEX (-7.7%), UNIONDAC (-7.4%) and AFRIPRUD (-5.8%) led  the decliners.
