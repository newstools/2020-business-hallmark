We have worked as a team for the last four years. Therefore, there is nothing new to any one of them.” “As you are already aware, the renewal of my tenure as Chairman of the Commission has been announced, subject to confirmation by the Senate. “Our work as election managers requires us to enforce the law, regulations, and guidelines.
