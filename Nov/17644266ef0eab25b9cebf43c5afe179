By ADEBAYO OBAJEMU For millions of suffering Nigerians, times are hard, and living has become hellish due to rising costs, occasioned by spiraling food prices and recent increases in prices of utilities such as electricity and fuel. Nigerians across board are complaining of the high cost of food commodities relative to poor purchasing power, Business Hallmark ‘s investigation has revealed. Many Nigerians spoken to by this newspaper complained of rising prices and expressed fears of looming food crises. James Deola, a mechanic said as a bread winner in his family, he can no longer guarantee them two meals again. “My family know that I have tried my best, but how much do I make a day, may be N2000 if i see a customer, but many days there are no customers. Sachet of tomato paste which used to go for N60 is now N150, while a piece of big onion is now N200.” Many breadwinners like Fella spoken to said they can no longer afford to feed their families three times a day as the prices of basic food items doubled in the past few months and their source of income dwindled. Many spoken to said they lost their means of livelihoods to COVID-19, and instead of social safety nets from government, ” the same government decided to punish us by increasing electricity and fuel prices”, Prekeme Amadi, a printer said in a chat with this newspaper. Some traders spoken to by BH said the high cost of food items was caused by the inability of farmers to produce enough for domestic consumption while international borders remained closed. ” The closure of borders has been counterproductive, you don’t just wake up and close borders without necessary measures in place to cushion it’s effects on the vulnerable. The policy was not well thought out. It has caused millions of Nigerians hardship, In addition to the geopolitical implications at the sub-regional levels. Look at what is happening to Nigerian traders in Ghana? We can not produce enough food, come to think of it, the home grown rice is costlier than imported one”, Dr. Olufemi Omoyele, a Public Affairs analyst who teaches management at Redeemers University told Business Hallmark in a telephone interview. Other people interacted with blamed the development on the increase in the price of petrol and electricity tariff. The complaint came at the time President Muhammadu Buhari convoked the meeting of the National Food Security Council (NFSC) where some of the stakeholders also raised the alarm of an impending food shortage in the country and the consequences. However, some of the attendees expressed optimism of overcoming the impending danger as farmers begun to harvest their produce. It seems the feferal government does not realise the looming food crises as Buhari at the meeting also warned the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) not to give a penny to anybody who intends to import food items or fertilizer, insisting that Nigeria has the capacity to feed itself. As it is now, it is tough time for the poor A survey carried out on commodity price by this newspaper in Lagos at different markets from Mile 12 , Mushin, Oshodi and Ile Epo showed that a 100kg bag of rice is sold at N54, 000 or more, while a 100kg bag of beans is sold at N21, 000.

To be honest, survival is becoming so difficult these days,” he said. Mohammed Abdul, a petty trader said , ” Things have changed, and life is hard now, this government is heartless . Now Nigerians now only look for what is affordable and available; prices of food commodities are so high and beyond the reach of the common man. I have two wives and five children and I earn a little above N40, 000. How do I survive in a situation where a 50kg of rice is sold at N26, 000?” he asked. Martin Nwachukwu, a commercial driver plying Agege – Agbado route, who is a father of five said he used to buy a bag of guinea corn that lasts for a month but could no longer afford it. ” Things are difficult in the country now. What i do now is to struggle hard to buy half of a bag these days and therefore my wife has to cut the ration we use daily.” He said he has five mouths to feed in addition to four children of his late brother   staying with him. In the face of this hardship, President Muhammadu Buhari insists there is enough food to feed the Nation. Recently, he directed the Central Bank of Nigeria “not to issue a kobo” of the country’s reserves for the importation of food items and fertilizer as the federal government rolls out the Economic Sustainability Plan and sets goals for National Food Security. The government not wanting to be blamed has shifted the food shortage and rising prices challenge to others.  The Nigerian government blamed the recent #EndSARS protests for the high cost of food currently being experienced by Nigerians. The government said the street protests against police brutality in many parts of the country “stalled food transportation and delivery.” This government’s angle was made known last   Wednesday at its weekly Federal Executive Council meeting. It was conveyed through a press statement signed by Laolu Akande, the spokesperson to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. The government said other factors responsible for the food prices increase include delay in going out to the farm, which translates to delay in harvesting courtesy of COVID-19 pandemic and banditry in the northwest effectively preventing farmers from harvesting fields cultivated.
