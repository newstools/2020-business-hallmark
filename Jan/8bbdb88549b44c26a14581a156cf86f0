The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff association, for instance, told our correspondent recently that it was high time the Federal Government channelled the funds spent on petrol subsidy to making the refineries work. “PENGASSAN has always called on the government of the day to ensure that our refineries are functioning optimally. The humongous amount spent on petrol subsidy should be invested in our refineries,” PENGASSAN spokesperson, Fortune Obi, said. He said the government could not be subsidising petrol forever, adding that the main solution was to remove subsidy and make the refineries functional.
