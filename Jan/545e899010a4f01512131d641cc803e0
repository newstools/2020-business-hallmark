Despite widespread subtle fears that the economic trends may not be favourably disposed to a bullish equities market this year, the market has already experienced a leap of sorts in the early days of 2020.

This has already created some excitement on Marina and Broad streets of Lagos. ‘This may be a good year’’, market observers are hoping. But the economy has remained weak at a slow growth of 2.23 per cent in the third quarter 2019. Whereas no expert can predict the market with accuracy, analysts sometimes are able hazard the picking of some stocks with potentials to reward investors with impressive returns in the short to long term. In the midst of complaints about the short comings in the management of the economy, stocks like Dangote Cement Plc, G T Bank, Nestle Nigeria, Fidelity, UBA among others have been fingered for investment.

Nestle Nigeria Plc Though Nestle Nigeria’s stock closed flat in the last 8 trading days at N1,469.90 per share, it is a blue chip given its antecedents.

Dangote Cement Dangote Cement has been tipped as one of the stocks to bet on in 2020. The company records huge sales every year. It is a popular brand that has now come to dominate the African Cement market and also now leaving its competitors far behind. Dangote Cement accounts for over 60 per cent of the cement market in Nigeria. Whereas it declared N154.35bn Profit After Tax in third quarter 2019, its revenue also declined by 0.8 to N679 billion due high to cost of operations. The company’s unaudited result for September 30, 2019 shows that profit before tax also declined by 20.1 per cent as asset also eased by 13.3 per cent to N856billion. Some of this can be explained. Ever since the Nigerian economy began to slip into very slow motion in growth terms, it had become difficult for firms to sustain a good profit position on the shrinking Gross Domestic growth (GDP) which stood at 2.3 percent in the third quarter of 2019. Mr. David Adonri, a Lagos based analyst believes that the weak economy which has shrunk the purchasing power of the population caused by low wages could however be affecting the firm’s sales figures. At the same time, the low performance had also been blamed partly on the bad roads situation and especially that of Apapa where the Port is located. The company said it lost over N50bn to bad roads and the congestion of the ports. But things may be looking up for the company given the construction of Oshodi –Apapa road which Dangote himself is handling for the government. This will ease transportation and timely evacuation of the company’s raw materials which are usually delayed at a high cost to the company. Many industry analysts believe that the sector may also be favoured this year given the capital budget of over N2.5 trillion for infrastructure. More interesting even is the fact that the Company has just head hunted the Managing Director of its main competitor, Lafarge Cement.
