BY EMEKA EJERE Nigerian will face another scarcity of petroleum products as some depots have stopped loading-trucks after the #EndSARS protests and the resultant crises  stopped the marketers from transiting their loaded trucks, Business Hallmark has learnt. It is even more so with the extension of the 24-hour curfew earlier imposed on Lagos State to 75 hours following the escalation of the protest. According to The Nation, the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN ) National Vice President, Alhaji Abubakar Maigandi, disclosed this in Abuja, said since petroleum products are highly inflammable, the drivers decided to park their trucks in safe places nationwide. He explained that since consumers buy fuel on daily basis and there is no replacement, there is bound to be a scarcity of petroleum products. Maigandi further said the marketers do not hoard products so there will be no reservoirs to turn to upon the exhaustion of available stock. Asked whether there is any fear of scarcity, he said “definitely, because some of the depots are not loading due of insecurity. “The ones that have already loaded parked their trucks in the yards so that protesters will not set them on fire. There is no way you can have sufficient fuels in the filling stations because we don’t do hoarding.” The IPMAN National Vice President urged the protesters to dialogue with the Federal Government for the amicable resolution of the crises. He asked them to embrace the olive branch because of the economic losses that emanate from the crisis. His words: “The EndSARS issue is a Nigerian issue so the protesters and government should dialogue over it for a lasting solution. Nigerians (both government and the governed need to have attitudinal change. So, it is better to dialogue. “
