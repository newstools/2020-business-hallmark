Former bank CEO and member of the All Progressives Congress in Abia State, Dr. Alex Otti (OFR), has felicitated with the government and people of Ngeria on the occasion of Nigeria’s 60th Independence Anniversary Celebration. Otti in a statement on Thursday, described Nigeria’s existence as an independent nation for 60 years now as a milestone that’s worthy of celebration, but regretted that the country has for a long time been bedeviled by too many socio-political and economic challenges too numerous and pronounced to be associated with such a nation with rich history and all round endowments. He frowned at a situation where sectional, religious and other trivial considerations still dominate our national discourse and general engagements, especially in sensitive leadership considerations to the extent that critical issues and challenges begging for urgent attention are relegated to the background while our development indices continue to go south,to the detriment of the people. Otti insisted that for Nigeria to overcome the numerous stormy challenges staring her in the face, leaders at all levels must review their leadership strategies and take a cue from other nations, especially those countries that once trailed Nigeria, but who have through the dint of hard work and visionary leadership overtaken Nigeria in all facets of development, so that the country could steer off the storms of political instability and economic underdevelopment, and begin a new process of national rediscovery that could see the welfare of Nigerians become top priority in all leadership considerations. He congratulated the people of his home state of Abia for their endless peaceful disposition, resilience and consistent demand for good governance, and enjoined all not to lose hope, assuring that consistent progressive push beyond political, religious and sectional platforms is what is required to herald an Abia that would meet the vision of Abia founding fathers, and desires of ordinary men and women of Abia. The ex bank Chief restated his call on Abia state government to prioritise the welfare of workers, pensioners and youths as an economic strategy to rejig the economy of the state and erase the present atmosphere of gloom and despondency created by harsh government policies and programs. He assured Abians that he would continue on the progressive path of lending his voice and taking very practical and decisive actions in alliance with well-meaning Abia sons and daughters with the utmost desire to develop the state, improve the welfare of Abians and ensure that God takes his pride of place in God’s Own State
