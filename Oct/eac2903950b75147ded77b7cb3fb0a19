OBINNA EZUGWU Thousands of Nigerians have taken to social media platform, Twitter to praise its Chief Executive Officer, Jack Dorsey for endorsing the ongoing protests for police reforms in the country. Nigerians have for the past two weeks, been agitating for an end to a police unit, the Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) using hash tag #EndSARS, while also protesting in hundreds and thousands in various states of the country, particularly Lagos and Abuja. The unit, a tactical squad has become notorious for extortion, harassment and even killing of mostly young people in Nigeria. Although the Inspector General of Police on Sunday, disbanded the unit and announced the formation of SWAT, another unit in its place, protests have continued with protesters demanding broader police reforms and an end to police brutality. Many have also rejected the newly formed SWAT insisting that it’s no different from SARS, though the police authorities have said members of the team will not operate like SARS. While allegations had emerged that Twitter was suspending users accounts for tweeting #EndSARS hash tag, Dorsey has won praises for openly identifying with the campaign by tweeting the #EndSARS hash tag and seeking donations via bitcoin for the protesters.
