Adebayo Obajemu Refineries in Nigeria, Africa’s top oil exporter, processed almost no crude oil in the 13 months to end June, according to the latest data published by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) on Thursday. In the same period, operating costs for the country’s three main oil refineries, which the NNPC has shuttered pending revamps, were $367 million.
