BY EMEKA EJERE Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Saturday visited the scene of the helicopter crash 24 hours after the incident. Speaking during the visit, Mr Sanwo-Olu stated that he was out of town when the incident occurred, and made it a point of duty to come and visit the residents, who narrowly escaped death, Â before another day passes. The governor, who met with the residents of both buildings where the crash occurred, rejoiced with them for not recording any casualty. Recall that a Bell 206 helicopter belonging to Quorum Aviation was traveling in from Port Harcourt, the Rivers state capital with two crew members and a passenger before it crashed into a residential building in the Opebi area of Lagos at mid-day on Friday. Shortly after the crash, the Lagos State Emergency Agency confirmed that two persons died in the accident, with the third person taken to the Lagos State Teaching Hospital for treatment, but it was confirmed by the Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) later on Friday that the third person died in the hospital. The AIB said it has commenced an investigation into what led to the crash, with a view to carrying out a fast and robust one with the help of the general public who have clips or saw the helicopter before it crashed.
