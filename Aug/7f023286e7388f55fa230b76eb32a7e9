By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo As part of its effort to avert further spread of Coronavirus pandemic in the state, Osun state government at the weekend embarked on decontamination exercise in worship centres and banks across the nooks and crannies of the state. Speaking on the importance of the excercise, the state commissioner for Environment and Sanitation, Hon. Sola Oladepo, who is also the Chairman Decontamination Committee, said the exercise became imperative in order to avert further spread of the pandemic. Oladepo said the government took it upon itself to decontaminate public places because only strong and expensive chemicals as recommended by the World Health Organisation, which the private fumigators cannot afford, are used by the government for the process, saying this will assist in killing the germs thereby limiting the spread. He stated that since the commencement of the exercise, the decontamination team had fumigated and disinfected more than 1,800 public and private schools in the state. He then advised the general public, especially school teachers to compliment government efforts by adhering strictly to the NCDC COVID-19 protocols through taking necessary precautionary measures such as good hygiene that will help to safeguard and protect the students during the period they are in school. Also speaking on the exercise, the Secretary of Environmental Health officers in the State, Mr Femi Ola commended the State Government for involving qualified and registered Environmental Officers in the decontamination process saying government had expended a lot to ensure that the exercise is thoroughly carried out. In his comment, the Dadani of Osogbo Central Mosque, Alhaji Abdusalam Alayo appreciated the government for its “extremely kind gesture” in combating the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in the State, while admonishing people to cultivate hygienic habit. Places visited by the team today are: Redeemed Christian Church of God, Breakthrough Cathedral, Ogo-Oluwa Osogbo, Osogbo Central Mosque Oja Oba, High Court of Justice Okefia, Markets and Zenith Bank among others.
