Adebayo Obajemu The much anticipated Q2 earnings of quoted companies on the floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange has finally hit the market. In the week that just ended, companies that released their Q2 results were up to 27. Overall, 74 firms have published their Q2 results so far. We expect more results must especially audited reports of the big banks to soon be released in the coming weeks. Market expectation for Q2 results of most firms is that it will reflect the impact of covid-19 on the businesses. Despite covid-19 disruption on businesses, Q2 results of some companies have been impressive with top line and bottom line growth year on year. Though, Q2 earnings of some firms reflected the impact of covid-19 impact on their figures. Hence we could say that performance of Q2 earnings for year 2020 is mixed. By and large, the market is beginning to think that Nigerians are good managers of businesses whether covid-19 or no covid-19. The impact of the pandemic did not hit them the way the market thinks it will. The market was thinking that most of the companies will be reporting lower revenue, but a sizable number of them actually did better than they did the previous quarter. Commenting on the Q2 results released so far, Bright Otoghile, Managing Director of Gruene Capital Limitedstated thus: “Performance of Q2 earnings is mixed. The covid-19 impact is obvious in some companies while some really show that they can still weather the storm. With no further lockdown issue, I think some of them might still perform the way they did in 2019 while some will not. So basically, the result of most of these companies, looking at the revenues of some like Julius Berger, Nestle, UACN and others in the consumer goods sectors, you will notice that something happened there. Many of them were just trying to breakeven. If you look at the construction sector, while Julius Berger shows sign of covid-19 impact, the same cannot be said of Dangote Cement and Wapco. In the banking sector, FBNH, FCMB, Union Bank and Wema Bank have released their results. We could see how the results faired, even though some of these results were actually boosted by the issue of assets disposal like First Bank for instance. That is a one off event. Otherwise I will advise investors to use the earnings per share from operations for FBNH. FCMB tried, their EPS grew to 49 kobo from 38 kobo. If you look at the month of April which actually carried the burden of the covid-19 impact, since we are not going to have that kind of April in future, most of this companies can weather the storm. The waiting game is for the big bank to see how they perform when their audited result start coming. Whether the results are good or not, consumer income is affected by the covid-19 pandemic impact. If the consumer income is low and we can see unemployment rate rising, what will they have for saving? What they invest is from what they save. If that is the case, we will see a mixed performance of the market in terms of see-saw performance. But for you to expect straight performance of the market, given good results from these companies, it might not be there. We are likely to experience good results and behaviour of consumers towards having their money somehow fixed in the capital market. Everybody is voting for cash as soon as they can get it. That is why we are experiencing ‘see- saw’ type of pricing performance”. Aruna Kebira, Chief Dealer of Global View Capital Limited in his comment about Q2 results stated thus: “The market is reacting according to the results that has been released. If you look at Seplat, the price has been declining, but the moment the result hit the market, it gained 10%, which means the price tends to move higher. MTN’s interim dividend information also hit the market. For MTN, because there is something to look behind it (interim dividend), it might likely move higher than N117.9 it closed last week. Wapco because of cost saving, their bottom line was actually impressive and took the price of the stock from N10.95 to 12.50, but eventually closed at N11.75. It came back home to rest. You know why, because there is nothing behind it; no interim dividend to look up to. I can assure you that most of the stocks that will pay interim dividend will perform well. We can see Guaranty Trust Bank and Zenith are beginning to respond, especially Zenith. Guaranty went to N23.30 and came back to close at N22.50. It is certain they are going to pay 30 kobo interim dividend. Because people are looking towards that 30 kobo, there will be that interest in it. So the interest will be sustained until there results are released. I believe it is time that the market may recover, if not for anything, but for the interim dividend. The effect of the lockdown is actually not reflecting like that on the earnings”. We should keep our fingers crossed and see how other companies will release their performance to the market and see how the market will react.
