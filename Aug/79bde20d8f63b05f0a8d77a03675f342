In pursuance of the consumer protection, information and education mandate, the Consumer Affairs Bureau (CAB) of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has requested proposals for the engagement of Consumer Advocacy Groups. This, according to the commission will enable the commission to establish a robust database of Consumer Advocacy Groups. The essence of the engagement is to have a database that will serve to inform and educate telecom consumers on their rights and responsibilities as well as create awareness for the Commissions activities and industry trends. “The objective is to have a pool of genuine Advocates who are passionate about consumer protection and are willing to inform and educate telecoms consumers; protect consumers from abuses, exploitation and deceit and assist NCC to educate telecom consumers on their rights and obligations,” NCC said in a public notice signed by Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, its Executive Vice Chairman. According to the notice, engaging the consumer advocacy group will help to bridge the communication gaps existing between consumers and the regulator on one hand, and the operating companies on the other, which will ultimately, help to obtain useful feedback to improve telecom service delivery. Their scope of work shall include assisting the Commission in creating consumer awareness and education; sensitizing telecom consumers and bridge information gaps on relevant consumer issues and assisting in mobilizing and enlightening some target consumers such as market women, artisans, the unskilled and the grassroots at various programmes and regulatory interventions by the Commission that benefit the consumers. Others are to provide leverage for the Commission to execute consumer-centric projects that will cover the six (6) Geopolitical zones and impact telecom consumers in the nook and crannies of Nigeria and assist in reaching out to special groups like the “Differently Abled People” to ensure all-inclusive participation in the Nigerian telecom space. Eligibility Criteria Telecom Consumer Advocacy Groups are encouraged to serve as Consumer Protection Ambassadors within their communities and should be able to meet the needs of the diverse population. This is to ensure that ICT consumers across the country are well informed irrespective of their geopolitical zones or inability to attend formal consumer-centric programs.
