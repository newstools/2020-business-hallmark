OBINNA EZUGWU The Nigerian Army have placed troops of 82 Division, Enugu, on high alert following the clash between the operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) and the Indigenous People of Biafra in Emene, Enugu, that resulted in the death of 21 IPOB members and two officers of the DSS.

Furthermore, on no account must troops allow their weapons to be taken away by criminal elements. “Commanders at all levels must make deliberate efforts to sensitise troops under command to maintain alertness and avoid individual movement in uniforms outside the barracks for now. Please treat very important and act.”
