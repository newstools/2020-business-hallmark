The Lagos State Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Salako, has reiterated that intending developers can obtain planning information free of charge through its Physical Planning Department. He disclosed this on Tuesday during the presentation of a progress report on the Lagos State Electronic Physical Planning System being developed by the Ministry. Dr Salako explained that planning information provided by the government is important in guiding developers on the assigned use of sites intended for building construction, saying the “Planning information gives details on land use and helps reduce infractions in the built environment”. He said that the Lagos State Government has always rendered planning information as a social service by making it available to members of the public at no cost and urged Lagosians to always avail themselves of the important free service as a prerequisite for determining whether to go ahead or not with a Physical Development Plan about a given site. The Commissioner emphasised that by making the service free and within the reach of Lagosians, the State has consistently improved her Ease of Doing Business rating, whilst contributing to the achievement of the T.H.E.M.E.S Agenda of the present government, particularly the ‘Making Lagos A 21st Century Economy’ pillar. “In view of its importance, planning information is being considered as an integral part of the ongoing efforts to adopt an electronic physical planning system in the State”, he disclosed.
