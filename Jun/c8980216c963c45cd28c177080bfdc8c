In a statement by Mr. Fidelis Damsuk Bitkop, Secretary General of GUDO, the organisation said a recent invitation extended to Justice Mensem-Dongban by the NJC for interview to the Supreme Court was suspicious and appeared to be “a grand design to short-change our illustrious daughter who has served and is still serving this country meritoriously at the Enugu Division of the Court of Appeal.” The statement read in part: “The attention of the Gamai Unity and Development Organisation (GUDO) has been drawn to the controversy trailing the recent invitation of our illustrious daughter Justice Monica Bolnaan Mensem-Dongban and Justice of the Court of Appeal by the National Judicial Council (NJC) for interview to the Supreme Court. We have received this news with mixed feelings and reservations in view of the glaring ulterior motives behind the exercise,” “We are compelled, on behalf of the entire Gamai people both at home and in the Diaspora, to speak strongly against what appears to be a grand design to short-change our illustrious daughter who has served and is still serving this country meritoriously at the Enugu Division of the Court of Appeal.
