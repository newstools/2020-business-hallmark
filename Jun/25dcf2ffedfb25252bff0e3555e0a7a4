According to Reuters, The telco, which is the largest telecoms company in Africa, allegedly aided militant groups in Afghanistan, including paying protection money, in an amended lawsuit filed on behalf of hundreds of families of US soldiers. The initial lawsuit was aimed at 8 multinational companies which include MTN, security firm G4S, US infrastructure group Louis Berger and consultancy Janus Global that operated in Afghanistan and Iran between 2009 and 2017. The suit which was filed in December 2019 in the United States District Court in the District of Colombia, alleges that these companies violated the US Anti-Terrorism Act by paying protection money to al-Qaeda and the Taliban.

The telecoms firm deactivated those towers at night, preventing US intelligence operations, MTN, however, has denied the allegations, asking the court to dismiss the original suit. This appears to be another round of fresh controversy for Africa’s largest mobile operator, which has had running battles in some countres, especially with an alleged security breach
