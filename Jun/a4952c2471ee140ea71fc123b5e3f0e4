…insists presidential system of govt not designed for poor countries The Chairman, Senate Committee on Army, Senator Ali Ndume, has said the presidential system of government was not designed for poor countries like Nigeria.
He instead called for reversion to the parliamentary system of government as a means of reducing the cost of governance in the country.
Ndume, who stated this in an interview with journalists in Abuja on Wednesday, also clarified that the lower cadre civil servants were not his target when he called on the government to slash salaries of public servants.
Ndume, who represents Borno South in the National Assembly, said he wouldn’t have called for the reduction of junior civil servants when he knew that they actually needed palliative to survive, even with their full salaries.
“I did not ask the Federal Government to slash the salaries of civil servants across the board during an interview I granted in Maiduguri.
“The statement credited to me was not a complete statement and I was quoted out of context. When they asked me questions about the revised budget, I said we should fasten our belt during this pandemic due to the fall in the prices of crude oil which is the mainstay of our economy.
“I said the Federal Government should critically look into cutting down the cost of governance. I called for the reduction of overhead cost, salaries of senior public servants, and the recurrent expenditure.
“That is what I said and I still stand by it. Taking cognisance of the fact that the salaries of the lower cadre civil servants are too small, I couldn’t have called for its further reduction.
“As a matter of fact, Nigerian civil servants in lower cadre deserve palliative from all tiers of government, even with their salaries.
