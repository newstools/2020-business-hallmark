Adebayo Obajemu For total compliance with fuel price directive, the Department of Petroleum Resources, DPR, Wednesday, gave kudos to oil marketers. Speaking after a surveillance of fuel retail outlets in the Federal Capital Territory, the Abuja Zonal Operations Controller of the DPR, Engr. Abubakar Buba, revealed that over 94 per cent of the petrol stations it monitored had complied with the new price and were selling at between N121.50 and N123.50 per litre. Buba stated the DPR undertook a series of enforcement activities, aimed at ensuring that marketers do not sell above the stipulated price range, do not under-dispense to motorists and do not divert the products to neighbouring states. He noted that of the 36 petrol retail outlets visited so far, only two — Rahamaniyya Oil and Gas, Mpape and Yinzag Petroils, Mabushi, where found selling above N123.50. He disclosed that both retail outlets were sealed and sanctioned and had been directed to comply with the new prices, after which they would be unsealed. In addition, Buba stated that the DPR has waded into the complaints of contaminated diesel being sold in some locations across the country, stating that its officials had visited these locations to collect samples of the products and it is currently waiting for the results of the tests conducted on the samples. He said, “We have received a lot of complaints; some of them we visited and took sample, and we are now waiting for the analysis. Athough the laboratory scientists are not available now, but the few management staff that we have, presently, are trying to make sure that they do the analysis
