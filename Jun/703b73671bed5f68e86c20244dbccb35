Speaking at the presentation ceremony, Oladunni said the bank would continually engage in initiatives that would protect the environment, especially those that were connected to the protection of lives through its partnership with LAWMA. She said the donation of the reflective highway managers uniforms to LAWMA “is one of the ways the bank contributes to the wellbeing of skilled and unskilled workers in the communities in which it does business across the country.” The statement quoted Odunmboni as saying, “Sterling Bank has been supporting us over the years and today they have donated another 5,000 uniforms to us again for the kitting of our sweepers.” He said the uniforms came at a time the authority had just expanded the number of sweepers across the state, noting that the donation would be adequate for distribution to all the sweepers on its payroll.
