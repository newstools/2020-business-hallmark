BY EMEKA EJERE As part of the activities to commemorate Nigeria’s Democracy Day, President Muhammadu Buhari will make a nationwide broadcast on Friday, June 12, 2020 at 7am. This is contained in a statement by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina. The statement enjoined television and radio stations as well as other electronic media outlets to hook up to the network services of the Nigerian Television Authority and Radio Nigeria respectively for the broadcast. Nigeria changed her Democracy Day from May 29 to June 12 last year in honour of the acclaimed winner of the freest and fairest election in the nation’s history, Chief Moshood Abiola. The result was annulled by the then military junta of General Ibrahim Babangida and Chief Abila later died in prison while pursuing his mandate.
