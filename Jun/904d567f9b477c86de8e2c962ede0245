The Federal Government has resolved to henceforth take decisive actions against rapists.
The decision was reached at the Wednesday meeting of the Federal Executive Council presided over by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).
The council took the decision after deliberating on a memo presented by the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen, on the increasing cases of rape across the country.
Protests have been holding across the country following serial cases of rape.
A 22-year-old student,Vera Omozuwa, raped and killed in a church in Benin City recently.
Also, 18-year-old Barakat Bello was also raped and macheted to death in Ibadan, Oyo State lately.
Tallen told State House correspondents that the issue was discussed at the council meeting.
She regretted that only nine states out of 36 have domesticated the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act.
