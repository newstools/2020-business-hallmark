The immediate past President and Chief Executive Officer of Transnational Corporation of Nigeria (Transcorp), Mr. Valentine Chineto “Val” Ozigbo, has noted that Anambra State needed a more focused and visionary leadership that would pursue collaboration to achieve her short term and long term developmental goals. Ozigbo who has made known his intention to run for governor in the upcoming 2021 election in the state under the platform People’s Democratic Party (PDP), stated this during an online ZOOM meeting with senior Journalists of the Eastern extraction. He said the state was endowed with huge potential, both human and materials, as well as has other capabilities which could take it to enviable height. Ozigbo who is about the most decorated black man in the hospitality industry across the globe, and had only months ago, resigned from his plump job at Transcorp to join politics, said he hungers for a better Anambra State as well as a better Nigeria and a better place for the black man. Describing Anambra State experience as that of blessed and missed opportunities, the widely travelled man whose wealth of experiences traverses banking, business, administrations and other endeavours said he possesses the quality mix and experience to pull together all the varied resources of the state and launch it to where it belongs in addition to making it competitive. According to him, “Anambra state needs to play a bigger role in the lives of not only the Igbo in Nigeria and diaspora, but also to restore dignity of the black man anywhere in the world.” He maintained that a lot more needed to be done in the area of making the state more “investment friendly” in order to attract both local and foreign investors. ‘’What we need in Anambra is efficiency and to make it more competitive. It is when you have made it investor friendly that you can attract all sorts of investors,” he noted.
