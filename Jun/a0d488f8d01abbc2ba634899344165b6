Adebayo Obajemu Ecobank has extended its zero charge for digital money transfers below N5,000 till the end of September. In addition to the free charge, users of Ecobank Mobile, Ecobank Online, and USSD – Ecobank *326#  will enjoy zero charge for digital money transfers below N5,000. New customers can also benefit from this by opening an Xpress account from the comfort of their homes by simply dialing *326#. The no charge for mobile money transfers by Ecobank  began in March as part of the bank’s  objective to cushion the rising spread of coronavirus. The decision to extend the zero charge policy is hinged on the bank’s drive to encourage citizens to adopt digital  banking particularly with the ongoing social distancing campaign targeted to check the spread of COVID-19. Head, Consumer Banking, Ecobank Nigeria, Olukorede Demola-Adeniyi,  said: “As a bank, our priority is people’s wellbeing. We place great emphasis on rewarding and identifying with our customers and citizens of Nigeria, especially at a time like this. We are determined to ensure that the impact of the pandemic is minimal on citizens. ‘’We encourage our customers to utilise our digital self-service solutions, including Ecobank mobile app, Ecobank Online, EcobankPay, Ecobank Omniplus, Omnilite and the rapid transfer app, where they can access their  bank accounts, make payments, transfer funds, process salaries and carry out ancillary banking transactions from the comfort of their home and offices without having to visit the branches
