BY EMEKA EJERE To promote cashless transactions across all its products, leading ride-hailing company, Uber has introduced a payment innovation called Uber Cash. The facility is designed to enable riders on Uber’s platform pay ahead for their trips and avoid stress. A release by the company indicates that facilitated by Flutterwave, an online payment solution, Uber Cash is set up to ensure easy and reliable digital payment option that will help ensure less physical contact between rider and driver in this era of COVID-19 pandemic. “Uber Cash is another way to create a seamless experience for all our users. This new option introduces a method of payment that is easily controllable, convenient and reliable,” says Alon Lits, Director of Uber in Sub-Saharan Africa. While existing payment options will still be available including cash (for rides only), debit card and gift cards, this new feature offers a seamless way to make and further control payment on Uber. This payment method creates an app-specific account that can be preloaded with any amount, to be used on upcoming trips. The account can be topped-up via the user’s Ride account and used as and when needed on Uber. “Top-ups are available and work similarly to that of an airtime increases. Riders are able to top-up their balance via a debit/ credit card (Verve), USSD, a bank transfer or Barter for payment of use. There is no need to use a physical card or cash,” the statement said.
