Re-echoing the sentiments of the MD, Head of Brands and Marketing Communications, Mrs Funmilayo Falola disclosed that “while at work, staff are to ensure they keep to all our health protocols, like wearing of face masks, disinfecting work desks regularly, and frequently making use of hand sanitizers”. Mr Adebise also encouraged bank customers to maintain strict adherence to the safety protocols both in the banking halls and in their respective environments. In his words, “customers are advised to take absolute responsibility for their safety and that of their families. Be vigilant in your neighbourhoods, on the roads, and in the banking halls. It is important for us all to be as alert as ever and not take the eased lockdown as a room for laxity”.
