Recall that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had in July 2019 increased banks’ Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) to 60%, up from 58.5%. Three months afterwards, the LDR was again increased to 65%, even as speculations were rife that it would further be increased to 70%. The apex bank later issued a circular announcing that LDR would be retained at 65%which is the current level. The main reason the CBN increased the LDR in the first place was to facilitate the provision of credit facilities to the real sector of the economy. The CBN incentives assigned a weight of 150% in respect of lending to SMEs, retail, mortgage, and consumer lending. Lenders are required to fully comply or risk attracting a levy of additional Cash Reserves Requirements of 50% of the lending shortfall of the target LDR.
