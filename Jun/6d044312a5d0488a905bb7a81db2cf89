Residents of Sagamu in Ogun State are now in fear after the state government confirmed that 104 workers of a factory in the city tested positive for Corovavirus.
The Ogun State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Tomi Coker, had on Wednesday night declared that 104 out of the 108 new COVID-19 cases in the state on Tuesday were from one company.
On Tuesday night, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control said the state recorded 108 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total to 471.
Coker said in Abeokuta that the state had recorded 13 COVID-19 deaths.
“104 cases are from a single site and they are all asymptomatic. 108 new cases, 104 from Sagamu, three from Abeokuta South and one from Yewa South.”
Also, the state government said there was no going back on its plan to reopen religious centres despite the alarming 108 COVID-19 cases recorded in the state within 24 hours.
The government said the latest figure, which was the highest figure it had recorded since the index case, was not a reflection of community spread of the virus.
The Special Adviser to the Governor on Public Communications, Remmy Hazzan, who stated this, said the 104 new cases were from one company in Sagamu.
He said the state government subjected the staff of some companies along Sagamu-interchange to what he called a total COVID-19 test, when it learnt that they were not observing protocols for the virus.
When asked if the recent 108 cases of COVID-19 recorded in the state within 24 hours would change the plan on the reopening of the worship centres, Hazzan said the incident “ is a reflection of the prevalence within the precinct of a factory.”
