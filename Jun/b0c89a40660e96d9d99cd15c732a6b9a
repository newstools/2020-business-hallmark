OBINNA EZUGWU Former Lagos State governor and acclaimed national leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC) Ashiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has said there is no cold war between himself and former Osun State governor, now Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, as according to him, he remains Aregbesola’s leader. This comes after days of speculations about a certain political rift between the two former governors, further fuelled by the decision of Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC), the highest decision-making body within the APC in Lagos, to disband all factional groups within the party, one of which is controlled by Aregbesola. However, Tinubu who denied having rift with Aregbesola in a statement by his media adviser, Tunde Rahman, argued that that “there is no war, cold or hot, between us.” Tinubu emphasised that there had never been and there would never be any form of misunderstanding between the two of them following the dissolution of the groups. “Today, the Governor’s Advisory Council, the highest decision-making body within the All Progressives Congress in Lagos State, passed a resolution calling for the disbandment of all factional groups within the party,” the statement reads. “This was to promote discipline, harmony and cohesion and engender party supremacy. The APC is one united political family in Lagos. I remain Ogbeni Aregbesola’s leader. “Our political family remains strong. The GAC is a very strong body within the APC leadership structure in Lagos. “And we are staying focused in our commitment to building and maintaining a cohesive political party. Its resolution is not targeted at any particular individual or collection of individuals. “The resolution was to restate the often-stated position that the only group known to us is APC and not any of the factional groups. The GAC position does not imply any division within the group.”
