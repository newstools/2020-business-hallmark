The Chief Imam of Lagos, Sheikh Sulaimon Oluwatoyin Abou-Nolla, has told mosques in the state to remain closed. He said the position of the Muslim community in the state is continued closure of the mosques.
It would be revalled that the state government recently permitted worship centres to reopen from June 19. But Abou-Nolla said there was no basis for the reopening of the religious centres going by the increasing figures of the COVID-19 index cases. “The mosque should still be closed because the number of index cases is still on the rise. They should not open Mosques for now. “The government should not rush to open religious centres since the reason for their closure has not been defeated,” Sheikh Abou-Nolla said.
