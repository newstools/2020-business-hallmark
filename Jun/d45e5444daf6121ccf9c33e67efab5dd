Barring a last minute glitch, the Senate will today (Thursday) confirm the appointment of Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem as the substantive President of the Appeal Court.
The Senate had abridged its legislative processes and procedures on Wenesday to expeditiously approve her nomination.
While declaring the intension of thesupper chamber to fast track the confirmation, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, said the decision became imperative to prevent a constitutional crisis in the judiciary.
“We are adjourning on Thursday for two weeks, by the grace of God, to celebrate our one year anniversary. And there could easily be a constitutional crisis if we don’t carry out the exercise of confirmation before we leave.
“This is clearly omitted in the Order Paper, and we find it necessary to consider it so that our Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters is able to do the screening today (Wednesday).
“Then on Thursday, we can receive and consider the report in order to ensure that we don’t leave anything as important as that undone.”
