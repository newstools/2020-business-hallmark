House of Representatives has voted against a prayer seeking to recommend castration for rapists. The House, at the plenary on Thursday, considered and adopted a motion on the rising cases of sexual violence in Nigeria. A member, Mr James Faleke, had recommended that persons found guilty of rape should be castrated. Just before the prayer was subjected to a voice vote, the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, however, asked what would happen to an older female who rapes a younger male. The comment generated noise in the chamber, putting the prayer to vote, the nays had it.
