OBINNA EZUGWU Drop in Nigerian government revenue has continued as the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) on Wednesday shared N547.309 billion to the three tiers of government for the month of May, down substantially from previous months. Hassan Dodo, director of information in the ministry of finance, budget and national planning who announced the amount in a statement, said the allocations were made after a virtual meeting chaired by Mahmoud Isa-Dutse, the permanent secretary in the ministry. Dodo noted that of the N547.309 billion for the month of May, the federal government received N219.799 billion, state governments got N152.436 billion and local government councils received N114.095 billion. The oil producing states also got N37.021 billion as 13 percent derivation fund. He added that the gross revenue from value added tax (VAT) for May rose by N9.377 billion. “The Gross Revenue available from the VAT for May was N103.873 billion against N94.498 billion distributed in the preceding month of April resulting in an increase of N9.377 billion,” he said. “The distribution is as follows: Federal Government got N14.490 billion, the States received N48.301 billion, Local Government Councils had N33.811 billon, while derivation got N0.000 and Cost of Collection and FIRS Refund/Allocation to NEDC got N7.271 billion. “The distributed Statutory Revenue of N413.953 billion received for the month was higher than the N370.411 billion received for the previous month by N43.542 billion, which the Federal Government got N191.580 billon, States received N97.172 billion and Local Governments got N74.915 billion.
