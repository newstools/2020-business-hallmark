BY EMEKA EJERE The House Committee Chairman of Niger-Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, has declared that he is ready to face a probe if found culpable of any misconduct. Tunji-Ojo spoke in response to the suggestion of prominent Ijaw leader, Chief Edwin Clark, that the Senate and House Chairmen on NDDC be removed from investigating the agency. The National Assembly is currently probing an allegation of N40 billion fraud against the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the NDDC. Clark, in an open letter to the leadership of the National Assembly, dated June 3, 2020, had said the allegations against the NDDC chairmen of both chambers were too weighty that they should not be swept under the carpet. He added: “Their statements or explanations are not enough at all. A new investigative panel should be constituted to investigate both the IMC and these members of the National Assembly. Tunji-Ojo, who addressed reporters yesterday, said: “I want to state very clearly that Baba Edwin Clark is our revered leader, not just to the Niger Delta but also to Nigeria. He is a man who has committed so much towards the development of the Niger Delta. But the point that I personally disagree with is the issue of documentary evidence and delay of the budget. “I have challenged the IMC more than three times on all media platforms, that if there is any documentary evidence against me, they should either bring it out or petition and submit such to relevant government anti-corruption agencies. “After all, I am a lawmaker and I do not enjoy any immunity. So, if there is any proof, they should act and stop throwing tantrums…”
