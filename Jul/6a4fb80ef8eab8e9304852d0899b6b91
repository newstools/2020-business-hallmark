Adebayo Obajemu In a landmark ruling July 2, Justice S. A. Onigbanjo of the High Court of Lagos State has ruled that members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) should not lose sleep as they do not need to be licensed by the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN) before they can file tax returns. The development is a sequel to a suit filed by CITN trying to restrain ICAN members from filing tax returns for their clients unless they have a practicing CITN license. A notice to ICAN members regarding this development, as seen by this newspaper noted that Justice Onigbanjo struck out the suit after describing it as “an abuse of court process and an embarrassment to the judiciary.” Reports available to Business Hallmark indicates that t disagreement between ICAN and CITN stemmed from the misinterpretation of a 2015 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and Terms of Settlement (ToS) between the two organisations. Consequently, CITN had filed a suit before the High Court of Lagos State, seeking the following: A declaration that the Memorandum of Understanding and Terms of Service both dated February 12, 2015 between the CITN and ICAN are valid, subsisting, and binding on the CITN and ICAN.
