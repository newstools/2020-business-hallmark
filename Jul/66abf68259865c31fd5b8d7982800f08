Dangote Cement Plc, however, reported earnings per share of 745kobo for the period ended June 2020 compared 707 kobo reported for the comparative period in 2019. The decline in Group Revenue was because of the weak Revenue from its Nigerian operations (-1.3% y/y to N610.2 billion), as the growth in sales volumes generated by sales promotions could not cushion the impact of price discounts offered to customers.
