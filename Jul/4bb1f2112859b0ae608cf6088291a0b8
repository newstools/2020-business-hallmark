Adebayo Obajemu The executive director in charge of research and advocacy at Association of Nigeria Electricity Distributors, Sunday Oduntan, has advocated for a Central Bank-funded massive roll-out of meters, saying this would expedite the efforts to achieve the full take-off of the proposed Service Reflective Tariff (SRT), Electricity distribution companies (Discos) have suggested. Such funding would help ensure that all electricity customers are adequately metered under the Meter Asset Provider (MAP) regulation. Oduntan, who said this in a statement to NAN on Friday, also disclosed that it would assist the distribution companies to meet the 2024 deadline which they had committed to, for metering all electricity consumers. He recalled that Mr Ernest Mupwaya, Managing Director of Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC), had spoken on behalf of the DisCos at the House of Representatives Public Hearing on the power sector on Thursday. According to Mupwaya, the Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) provision in Nigeriaâ€™s electricity tariff was insufficient to cover the cost of metering customers.
