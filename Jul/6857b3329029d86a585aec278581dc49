Adebayo Obajemu Federal Government has finally given approval for reconstituted boards of Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas(NLNG) and Bonny Gas Transport Limited (BGT). This development was made known via a statement issued by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, in Abuja on Monday.

Other Members include the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Corporation (NNPC), Malam Mele Kyari and the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Mr Bitrus Nabasu.
