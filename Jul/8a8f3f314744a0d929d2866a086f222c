Age, they say, is wisdom if one has lived one’s life properly. People should be mindful of the legacies they bequeath to the younger generations as they age, and all these Babas ought to know that lying shouldn’t be one of such legacies. When Baba Francis Fadahunsi lied about four days ago, I tarried awhile, waiting to see if his office would disown the lies credited to him. After 24 hours, without reading any disclaimer from Baba Fadahunsi, I debunked the lies. After debunking the lies, his spokesman, Pastor Segun Progress, came up to say “Senator Fadahunsi never made any statement on N9B, it’s an idle government with a lot to hid that will use quality time responding to a WhatsApp post. Osun really needs deliverance.” It did not stop there. Some PDP social media guys joined him to chorus the above lines. Ironically, among those who joined him were people who had used Baba Fadahunsi’s false claims as basis to malign and haul insults at my principal, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola. In a saner clime, these people ought to have first apologised for accusing the government and the governor wrongly before looking at the propriety or otherwise of our response. To further confirm their lies, I am aware that Baba Fadahunsi and his spokesman have so far turned down two separate requests to have a conversation with me on their bogus claims. Rave FM’s “Frank Talk” anchor, Mr. Femi Olanipekun, said so during the programme he hosted on Wednesday, where I had featured to further reinforce our position that these people are peddlers of lies. I was, therefore, taken aback this morning to read another Baba, who incidentally is the acting Chairman of a faction of the PDP in the state, Elder Sunday Atitade trying to reinforce a claim Baba Fadahunsi had since denied. Long before Baba Fadahunsi made his bogus claims, we had lined up Commissioners, Special Advisers, and other government officials to kick-start a ministerial briefing today. Thank God, one of those lined up is a member of our Health Revitalisation Committee. I am sure all the issues raised in the PDP Press Release will be addressed. But before then, let me hasten to add that only the blind will fail to see our intervention in the Health Sector. In Ede, where Baba Sunday Atitade hails from, we have done more than 10 of the Primary Healthcare Centres, PHCs. Did he visit any of them, and he could not find the structure there or what? Where was Baba on September 16, 2019? We were at Adejuwon in Ede North, to inaugurate one of the PHCs. Baba, you need not travel to Osogbo from Ede, to not only see these structures, but feel the presence of a government that is not discriminatory. In case the naysayers have forgotten, apart from rehabilitating and renovating these PHCs, these are the other components associated with the revitalisation of the PHCs: Water Project with 5,000 litres of storage tanks and six fetching bays for the host communities where the PHC is located, medical equipment supplied to each focal PHCs that is under Rehabilitation, Adult and Infant weighing scale, blood pressure monitor, beddings and drugs among many other requirements as prescribed by WHO. Below are some of our interventions in the health sector: STATUS OF OTHER HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURAL PROJECTS AS AT 16/07/2020 S/N PROJECT REMARKS 1.
