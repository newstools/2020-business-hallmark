Our Maintenance, repair and Overall (MRO) facility was due for completion and we were to take delivery of the first ever helicopter flight simulator in sub Saharan Africa. We also anticipated good fortunes for our marine business as we had been pre qualified for a number of contracts. Unfortunately the Corona virus pandemic sweeping across the globe has turned 2020 to an annus horribilis which has seen project dates pushed back and potential contraction and indefinite suspension of some contracts. As we all come to terms with the unprecedented effects of the pandemic and its negative impact on our economy, financial prudence is our watchword. We are mindful that these are extremely challenging times but we remain resolute to maintaining the same level of service our clients are accustomed to whilst preserving shareholder value.”
