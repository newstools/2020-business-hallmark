It is followed by Italy with 31,610 deaths and 223,885 cases, France with 27,529 deaths and 178,870 infections and Spain with 27,459 fatalities and 230,183 cases. The country with the highest number of deaths compared to its population is Belgium with 77 fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants, followed by Spain with 59, Italy 52, Britain 50 and France 42. China — excluding Hong Kong and Macau — has to date declared 4,633 deaths and 82,933 cases. It has 78,209 recovered cases. Europe has a total of 164,137 deaths from 1,848,598 cases, the United States and Canada have 92,386 deaths and 1,504,523 cases, Latin America and the Caribbean have 25,690 deaths and 454,107 cases, Asia has 11,696 deaths and 336,428 cases, the Middle East has 7,983 deaths and 262,778 cases, Africa has 2,601 deaths from 76,941 cases and Oceania 126 deaths from 8,363 cases.
