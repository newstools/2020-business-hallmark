By FELIX OLOYEDE Nigerian big banks put up a better-than-expected performance in the first half of the year despite the adverse impact of the coronavirus pandemic of the economy during this period, Majority of the too-big-to-fail lenders took advantage of their digital platforms and foreign exchange adjustment to grow their revenue, offsetting the decline in interest incomes, which was caused the five weeks economic lockdown, enforced by the government to curtail the spread of COVID-19. Mr. Charles Sanni, Managing Director/Chief Executive, Cowry Treasurers Limited, argued that with the half-year performance, the banking sector has shown that it is sustainable, and the banks are keen in their growth trajectory. “The volume of transactions that went through the bank during the pandemic particularly during the lockdown, through the digital banking was a major driver during the period,” he explained. He also added that though people were at home during the lockdown investment segment of the economy was up and running during this period. “It also showed that the banking sector is ready for the new normal,” Mr. Sanni said. Mr. Rotimi Fakayejo, Managing Director, Enterprise Stockbrokers, noted that despite the    marginal drop in the gross earnings and profits of these top banks, their performance in H1 2020 is commendable. “Despite the COVID-19 lockdown, they were able to come up with this kind of results. They were able to make up for the decline in their interest income through the revenue from e-business which grew significantly during this period,” he said. Mr. Moses Ojo, Chief Economist/Head, Investment Research, PanAfrican Capital Holdings, tied the better-than-expected performance of the top lenders to the disruption in the country’s foreign exchange market, which caused their income from other sources to increase during H1 2020 compared to the same period last. He added the CBN policy which compelled banks to give out 65 per cent of their total deposits as loans to help stimulate economic growth in the country, also spurred the impressive performance of the big banks in H1 2020. Zenith Bank makes a double-digit profit Zenith Bank is one of the big lenders, which was able to weather the storm to grow its interest income and post a double-figure profit in the first six months of 2020. The audited half-year result of the bank showed 4per cent growth in gross revenue to N346billion during this period, driven by 1 per cent rise in interest income and non-interest income which was up 6 per cent. The marginal growth in interest income is traceable to revenue from loans and advances to customers which ticked up 11.58 per cent to N128.37 billion and placement with banks and discount houses which increased 41.34 per cent to N16.65 billion, but this was counteracted by earnings from treasury bills dipped -46.49 per cent to N28.38 billion in H1 2020. Zenith Bank pretax profit expanded 2 per cent to N114.12 and post-tax profit went up 17 per cent to N103.82 billion, lifted by the significant drop in income tax expense, which was more than halved from N10.30 billion in H1 2019 to N20.94 billion in the first six months this year. This was despite impairment charges on bad loans rising 74.2 per cent to N23.9 billion, propelled by 478.95 per cent increase in provision for losses in investment securities, as the bank non-performing loan was only 0.3 per cent less than the regulatory 5 per cent set the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), 10 per cent higher to 4.30 per cent of its total which was bad in the same period last year. The bank improved total loans by 14 per cent to N2.80 trillion, while customer deposits grew by 15 per cent to N4.9 trillion, with total liabilities growing at a faster pace of 21.9 per cent to N6.59 trillion than total assets which went up by 19 per cent to N7.58 trillion; Shareholders’ fund also strengthened 5 per cent to N988.98 billion between December 2019 and June this year. Zenith Bank is very liquid with a liquidity ratio standing at 50.8per cent compared to 57.3 per cent as of December 2019; the threshold set by the CBN is 30 per cent. The bank’s loan to deposit ratio was slightly above the 65 per cent regulatory benchmark at 66.1 per cent, while capital adequacy ratio (CAR) was 20 per cent, a marginal dip from 22 per cent it had in December last year. The bank’s shareholders will be getting N0.30 interim dividend for the first half of the year.

The bank grew profit-after-tax (PAT) by 24.7 per cent to N45.2 billion, pretax profit improved 17.4 per cent to N52.4 billion in H1 2020, the PAT was bolstered by 14.3  per cent lower tax paid during this period. Meanwhile, revenue grew 7.8 per cent to N126.6 billion, aided by 27.2 per cent rise in Non-Interest Income, notwithstanding the 9.3 per cent plunge in interest income. The growth 27.2 per cent in non-interest revenue to N69.8 billion was driven largely by a 95 per cent year-on-year increase in trading income, while the 9 per cent decline in Interest income to ₦55.1 billion in H1 2020 was attributed to depressed asset yields despite the comparative growth recorded in loans year-on-year. Interest expense also declined by 18 per cent following deposit repricing and improvement in deposit mix towards cheap funds The bank made N6.4 billion impairment provision for its toxic assets compared to a write-back of N557 million in H1 2019 as its NPL ratio climbed to 4.9 per cent in June from 3.9 per cent last December. Stanbic IBTC Bank also made some cuts in cost with operating expenses declining by 3 per cent year-on-year to ₦48.5 billion; other operating expenses declined by 5 per cent due to savings in premises and communication expenses, causing Cost-to-income ratio to improve to 45.2 per cent from 53.2 per cent recorded in the prior year. Effective tax rate decreased to 13.7 per cent in H1 2020 from 18.8 per cent in the period year because of the change in tax basis for the banking subsidiary.

Gross earnings were up 5.8 per cent to ₦296.4 billion, buoyed by 46.8 per cent growth in non-interest income, driven by fees and commission and gains on investment securities, but counterbalanced by over 50 per cent in interest income, due to significant dip in investment securities during this period. Trading income in the form of net gains in investment securities was up due to the significant volatility in the financial markets, and Electronic banking also contributed meaningfully to the growth into non-interest income, just like the revenue from Letters of credit which grew 82.1 per cent in H1 2020. It also leveraged on its digital banking during the lockdown as agent banking contribution to e-business revenue increased from 13.9 per cent in H1 2019 to 29.3 per cent in H1 2020. The Group’s performance was also lifted by the completion of the sale of 65 per cent of its stake in FBN Insurance Limited to Sanlam Emerging Markets Limited in the first half of the year. It grew operating Income 7.7 per cent to ₦211.4 billion, operating expenses also followed the same trend, rising 0.9 per cent to ₦139.2 billion. FBNH set aside ₦30.7 billion as Impairment Charges for bad loans, which was 38.6 per cent higher than the ₦22.1 billion provisions it made in the same period last year, but it sustained improvement in NPL ratio from 9.9 per cent in 2019 to 8.8 per cent in H1 2020, which was above the 5 per cent regulatory threshold.

However, this could not prevent the pre-tax profit from slipping 18.70 per cent to N57.13 billion and post-tax profit going down 21.70 per cent to N44.43 billion, due impairment provision on loan losses with rose by 150.32 per cent, employee benefit expenses which were up 19.87 per cent and other operating expenses increasing by 22.60 per cent during this period.
