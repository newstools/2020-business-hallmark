The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) has been named the best-performing stock market among the 93 equity indexes tracked by Bloomberg globally. The all-share index which opened at 38,800.01 inched higher by 310.16 points or 0.80 percent to cross the 39,000 mark and close at 39,110.17. Also, the market capitalisation rose by N167 billion to close at N20.446 trillion compared with N20.279 trillion achieved on Thursday before the Christmas and Boxing Day holidays. Year-to-date returns are currently at 45.7 percent; the best annual return since 2013. Investors booked N7.31 trillion in gains as of December 22, 2020, a rally supported by the dovish stand of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The CBN cut the base monetary policy rate by 200 basis points to 11. 5 percent, in order to boost lending, discourage savings and drive growth to counter the pandemic effect on the economy, while also keeping rates low in the fixed income market. Excess liquidity (created by CBN’s OMO restriction), the hunt for double-digit yields and depressed pricing, helped to rekindle local interests in the equities market in 2020. The uptrend recorded at the end of trading on Tuesday, the Cable reported, was driven by price appreciation in medium and large capitalised stocks amongst which are; BUA Cement, Zenith Bank, Access Bank, NPF Microfinance Bank and NEM Insurance.
