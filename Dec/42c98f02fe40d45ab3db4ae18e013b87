Oyo State governor, Engr. Seyi Makinde has said bandits are crossing into Nigeria through some international borders in Oke Ogun axis of the state. The governor who spoke during a visit to the palace of the Okere of Saki, Oba Khalid Olabisi, where he met with traditional rulers from Oke Ogun Zone 1, Oyo State on Monday, said the state was able to tackle banditry with the support of the traditional rulers and some other stakeholders in the state. “For instance, Saki shares an international border and it is more of an international issue because we have bandits all the way from Mali that are trying to cross. Once they gain entrance into anywhere they can operate, they will stay there,” he said. “When we inaugurated Amotekun, you gave us your support. When some bandits went to the bush at Kishi, we were able to flush them out with all the efforts of all of us here.”
