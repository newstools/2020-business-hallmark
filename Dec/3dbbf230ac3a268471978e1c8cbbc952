The Senate Public Accounts Committee has upheld a 2015 query raised against the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) overpayment of N8.6 million for un-executed contract. The panel upheld the query of the Auditor General of the Federation against NIMASA after the agency failed to appear before the committee after a series of invitations without response. The chairman of the committee, Senator Matthew Urhoghide, said since the agency had failed to appear, the committee had no other option than to sustain the query of the auditor-general on the agency.
