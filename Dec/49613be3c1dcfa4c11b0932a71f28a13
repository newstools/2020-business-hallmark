Adebayo Obajemu Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has inaugurated a Permanent Triage and Oxygen Therapy Centre in the Eti-Osa Local Government Area of the state to provide swift emergency oxygen therapy to residents of the community. The facility, which will double as a COVID-19 sample collection centre, is one of 10 others in 10 LGAs of the state with high burdens of COVID-19 cases. Sanwo-Olu, while speaking during the inauguration of the facility, disclosed that the need to better manage severe to critical COVID-19 cases spurred the state government to build and deploy the 10 oxygen therapy centres. He said, “One of the strategies adopted in response to the recent increase in COVID-19 infections is the provision of the COVID-19 Permanent Sample Collection Triage and Oxygen Therapy Centre in 10 local government areas across Lagos to support patients with oxygen before they are transferred to care centres.” The governor, who was represented by the state Commissioner for Health, Prof Akin Abayomi, explained that the project was inevitable to prepare against the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. He stated further that the facility could not have come at a better time than now when the state was recording an increase in the number of people presenting with difficulty in breathing and requiring urgent oxygen therapy.
