Do you have a dream ecommerce idea yearning to go live, or you’ve just had an ear-biting bout with Mike Tysons of the hosting world? Before you make some hasty decisions, please read this. Many site owners have suffered untold losses from being with poor hosts. I have some 20 years experience hosting sites and dealing with diverse net-preneurs whose online presence range from poor to fantastic, small to large scale and I’ve had a fair share of incidences which had me in the hospital, no thanks to hosts like HostGator and GoDaddy. Many of these hosts actually make moving a hellish experience. HostGator once devastated me with the loss of  6 years of journalistic materials, the efforts of more than a hundred reporters across Nigeria, over some shady server fault. But I must admit my naivety about law and other issues, which the host promptly preyed on. I had to crawl all the way back up again, in a gruesome manner. That was a glimpse of my experience with hosting. Many site owners have suffered untold losses running on poor, shady hosts. Are you a net-prenuer? You need to first of all, get yourself clear with hosting your business. It is principal to your success online.  So my discovery of https://g7cloud.com/secure/aff.php?aff=7 was a blessing and a thorough relief. It got me becoming lazy. What with all the perks and support personnel who handled my own errors like nothing happened. I think the idea is they sleep better when you sleep better. Since I discovered https://g7cloud.com/secure/aff.php?aff=7, I have not looked back since then. I guess they thrive on more referrals than on some bogus marketing budgets and gimmicks.
