Under reported, underappreciated underutilized, uncelebrated, yet Jimanze will be adjudged one of the greatest African intellectuals of the 21st Century,” Adeniyi said. “A profound philosopher of uncommon depth, Jimanze was bold, forthright and stubbornly unapologetic about his convictions. Great minds live forever, so shall your noble soul.” “Your commitment to the League of Nigerian Columnists was without parallel.” A renowned intellectual, journalist, poet and writer, Jimanze passed away on Christmas day.
