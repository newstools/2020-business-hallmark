The Catholic Archdiocese of Owerri, Imo state has dismissed the reported death of its auxiliary bishop, Moses Chikwe. Nnaemeka Njezi, the diocesean assistant secretary, said in a statement that the report of the bishop’s death is unconfirmed and misleading. The clarification comes following reports that the bishop’s head was found in a village road side at Nkpor, Anambra State. The Bishop was abducted by armed men at about 6.30pm Sunday evening after officiating at a church programme at Annunciation Parish, World Bank, New Owerri. Njezi denied the rumour hours after and asked Nigerians to continue to pray for the release of the bishop and his driver. His statement read: “His Grace, Most Rev Anthony J. V. Obinna, Archbishop of Owerri, hereby requests all Christ’s faithful and people of goodwill at large to disregard the purported news feed on the killing of the Auxiliary Bishop of Owerri Archdiocese, Most Rev. Moses Chikwe. “This information is unconfirmed, misleading and does not come from the Catholic Archdiocese of Owerri. “We continue to appeal that all join the Archbishop in prayers for the release of Bishop Chikwe and Mr. Nduduisi Robert, his driver.” The state police command earlier said it has deployed a tactical squad to hunt the kidnappers and free the captives
